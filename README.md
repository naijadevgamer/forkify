## 🌟 Project Overview

Forkify is a project inspired by a course created by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/). The app is built using the **MVC architecture** and makes use of various tools and technologies such as **HTML**, **SCSS**, **JavaScript**, **Parcel**, and **Babel**. It's perfect for anyone looking to explore the world of cooking or improve their web development skills! 🍲

Here’s what the Forkify app can do:

- **Recipe Search 🔍**: Search for thousands of recipes by ingredients or dish names.
- **View Recipes 📜**: See detailed instructions and ingredients for each recipe.
- **Responsive Design 📱**: Enjoy a user-friendly experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Bookmark Recipes 💾**: Save your favorite recipes to easily find them later.
- **Add Recipes ➕**: Share your own culinary creations with the world.
- **Delete Recipes ❌**: Remove unwanted recipes that you've added.
- **Pagination 📄**: Browse through search results with ease using pagination.
- **Adjust Servings 🍽️**: Change the number of servings to suit your needs.

### ✨ Additional Features by Me

I've made some improvements to enhance the original project:

- **Responsive Design Enhancements**: The app is now fully responsive across different devices, not just desktops. 🎨
- **User-Friendly Recipe Submission**: Made the form to submit recipes more straightforward and easier to interact with.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **HTML**: Structure and semantics of the web pages.
- **SCSS**: For styling the app with variables and mixins.

- **Parcel**: Bundler for optimizing and building the app.
- **Babel**: Transpiler to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

## 📚 Architecture

The Forkify app follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture. Here's a brief overview:

- **Model**: Handles the data logic and interactions with external services.
- **View**: Manages the UI components and DOM manipulation.
- **Controller**: Orchestrates the app logic, connecting the model and view.

## 🔧 Usage
